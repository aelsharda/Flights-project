# Flights-project
End-to-end data analysis project on U.S. flights (2015). Includes raw dataset, SQL queries for exploration and insights, and a Power BI dashboard visualizing cancellations, delays, airline reliability, and airport performance.

# ✈️ Flight Delays Analysis Project (2015)

This project explores flight delay patterns in the U.S. using **SQL** and **Power BI**.  
It answers key questions such as:  
- What percentage of flights were delayed or cancelled?  
- Which airlines were the most and least reliable?  
- What were the main causes of delays (airline, weather, NAS, etc.)?  
- Which routes and airports contributed most to total delay minutes?  
- How did delays change month over month in 2015?
